# Git-Commands

You Can do by Two ways,

1. Cloning the Remote Repo to your Local host

example: git clone https://github.com/user-name/repository.git

2. Pulling the Remote Repo to your Local host

First you have to create a git local repo by,

example: git init or git init repo-name then, git pull https://github.com/user-name/repository.git

That's all, All commits and branch in the remote repo now available in the local repository of your computer.

Happy Coding, cheers -:)
